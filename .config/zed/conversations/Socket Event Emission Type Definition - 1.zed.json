Let's break it down:\n\n1. `emit`: This is a method used to send events from the server to connected clients\n\n2. `<T>`: This is a generic type parameter that allows the function to work with different data types\n\n3. `(ev: ServerEvents, data: T) => boolean`: This describes the function signature where:\n   - `ev: ServerEvents` is the event name/type (from an enum or type of valid server events)\n   - `data: T` is the payload data being sent with the event\n   - `=> boolean` indicates the function returns a boolean (typically indicating if the emit was successful)\n\nThis type definition ensures type safety when sending events from the server to clients, making sure:\n- Only valid server events are emitted\n- The data being sent matches the expected type for that event\n- The return value is properly typed as a boolean\n\nIt's part of the TypeScript type system to provide better type checking and autocompletion when working with Socket.IO events in the multiplayer game context.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":23}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":345,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":24}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":1421,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":25}}}],"summary":"Socket Event Emission Type Definition","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
