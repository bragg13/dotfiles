For a Yarn workspace setup where the server needs to access shared code, here are a few things to check and fix:\n\n1. First, verify your workspace setup in the root `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"workspaces/*\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n2. Make sure the shared package is properly defined in its `package.json`:\n\n```json\n// workspaces/shared/package.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"settlers-shared\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"dist/index.js\",\n  \"types\": \"dist/index.d.ts\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. In your server's `package.json`, make sure you have the shared package as a dependency:\n\n```json\n// workspaces/server/package.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"server\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"settlers-shared\": \"*\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Check your TypeScript configuration in the server:\n\n```json\n// workspaces/server/tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"settlers-shared/*\": [\"../shared/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. Make sure you're building the shared package before running the server. Add a build script in your root `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"yarn workspace settlers-shared build && yarn workspace server build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n6. Also verify that the import path in your server code is correct:\n\n```typescript\n// Instead of\nimport { ClientEvents } from 'settlers-shared/client/ClientEvents';\n\n// Try\nimport { ClientEvents } from 'settlers-shared';\n```\n\n7. Make sure you've run `yarn install` in the root directory after setting up the dependencies.\n\nIf you're still having issues, you might want to try:\n\n1. Clear your node_modules and yarn cache:\n```bash\nrm -rf node_modules\nrm -rf workspaces/*/node_modules\nyarn cache clean\nyarn install\n```\n\n2. Check if the shared package is being built correctly and the compiled files are where they should be.\n\nCould you share your workspace structure and the relevant package.json files? That would help identify the specific issue.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":52}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":6},"start":1449,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":53}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":45},"start":1451,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":54}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":46},"start":3494,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":55}}}],"summary":"Server Cannot Import From Shared Module In Yarn Workspace","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
