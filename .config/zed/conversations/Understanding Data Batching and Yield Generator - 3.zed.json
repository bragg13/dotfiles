The function takes fMRI data from both hemispheres, images, subject indices, batch size, and number of subjects as inputs\n\n2. It converts input lists to numpy arrays for efficient processing\n\n3. The `while True` creates an infinite loop to continuously generate batches\n\n4. For each iteration:\n   - It creates a random permutation of indices (shuffling the data)\n   - The permutation length is adjusted to be divisible by batch_size\n   - It then yields batches of data in sequence\n\n5. The `yield` keyword is crucial here - it makes this function a generator:\n   - Instead of returning all batches at once (which could be memory intensive)\n   - It returns one batch at a time\n   - The function \"pauses\" at the yield statement and resumes from there when the next batch is requested\n   - This is memory efficient as it only holds one batch in memory at a time\n\nExample usage would look like:\n```python\nbatch_generator = make_batches(lh_data, rh_data, images, subject_idx, 32, 10)\nfor lh, rh, img, subj in batch_generator:\n    # Process one batch at a time\n    # Each iteration gets fresh, randomly sampled batch\n```\n\nThis is particularly useful for training deep learning models where you want to:\n- Process data in batches\n- Randomize the order of samples\n- Efficiently handle large datasets that don't fit in memory\n\nThe commented-out lines suggest there was previously some expansion operation for subject-specific processing that's currently disabled.\n\n```py neuroscope/src/train.py:1-77\n# Excerpt from: \n# train.py\n#     neuroscope project\n# by: Noah Syrkis\n\n# imports\nimport jax\nfrom jax import grad, jit\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport numpy as np\nimport wandb\nimport haiku as hk\nimport optax\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Dict\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom src.model import loss_fn, init, apply\n\n\n# functions\ndef hyperparam_fn():  # TODO: perhaps have hyperparam ranges be in config.yaml\n    return {\n        'batch_size': 32,\n        'n_steps': 10000,\n        'dropout_rate': 0.5\n    }\n\ndef update_fn(params, rng, fmri, img, opt_state, opt, dropout_rate):\n    rng, key = jax.random.split(rng)\n    grads = grad(loss_fn)(params, key, fmri, img, dropout_rate=dropout_rate)\n    updates, opt_state = opt.update(grads, opt_state, params)\n    params = optax.apply_updates(params, updates)\n    return params, opt_state\n\n\ndef train_loop(rng, opt, train_loader, val_loader, plot_batch, hyperparams):\n    fold_metrics = []\n    rng, key = jax.random.split(rng, 2)\n    lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)\n    params = init(key, lh)\n    opt_state = opt.init(params)\n    update = partial(update_fn, opt=opt, dropout_rate=hyperparams['dropout_rate'])\n    for step in range(hyperparams['n_steps']):\n        rng, key = jax.random.split(rng)\n        lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)\n        params, opt_state = update(params, key, lh, img, opt_state)\n        if (step % (hyperparams['n_steps'] // 100)) == 0:\n            rng, key = jax.random.split(rng)\n            metrics = evaluate(params, key, train_loader, val_loader)\n            fold_metrics.append(metrics)\n    return metrics, params\n\n\ndef evaluate(params, rng, train_loader, val_loader, n_steps=2):\n    # each batch is a tuple(lh, rh, img).

The main entry point is `train_folds(kfolds, hyperparams, seed=0)` where `kfolds` is a collection of (train_loader, val_loader) pairs\n\n2. Each loader (train_loader and val_loader) would be an instance of the generator created by `make_batches`. This is evident from how they're used:\n\n```python\nlh, rh, img = next(train_loader)  # Unpacking what make_batches yields\n```\n\n3. The training loop repeatedly calls `next(train_loader)` to get new batches of data:\n```python\nfor step in range(hyperparams['n_steps']):\n    lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)  # Gets next batch from make_batches generator\n    params, opt_state = update(params, key, lh, img, opt_state)\n```\n\n4. Similarly in evaluation:\n```python\ndef evaluate(params, rng, train_loader, val_loader, n_steps=2):\n    for _ in range(n_steps):\n        lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)  # Gets next batch\n        # ... use the batch for evaluation\n```\n\nSo while `make_batches` isn't directly referenced here, it's the underlying generator that provides the data streams (`train_loader` and `val_loader`) used throughout the training process. It continuously provides fresh, randomly shuffled batches of data for training and validation.\n\nThe loaders would likely be created somewhere else in the code (probably where the k-fold cross validation is set up) using something like:\n```python\ntrain_loader = make_batches(train_lh, train_rh, train_images, train_subjects, batch_size, n_subjects)\nval_loader = make_batches(val_lh, val_rh, val_images, val_subjects, batch_size, n_subjects)\n```\n\n```py neuroscope/src/train.py:34-77\n# Excerpt from: \n\ndef train_loop(rng, opt, train_loader, val_loader, plot_batch, hyperparams):\n    fold_metrics = []\n    rng, key = jax.random.split(rng, 2)\n    lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)\n    params = init(key, lh)\n    opt_state = opt.init(params)\n    update = partial(update_fn, opt=opt, dropout_rate=hyperparams['dropout_rate'])\n    for step in range(hyperparams['n_steps']):\n        rng, key = jax.random.split(rng)\n        lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)\n        params, opt_state = update(params, key, lh, img, opt_state)\n        if (step % (hyperparams['n_steps'] // 100)) == 0:\n            rng, key = jax.random.split(rng)\n            metrics = evaluate(params, key, train_loader, val_loader)\n            fold_metrics.append(metrics)\n    return metrics, params\n\n\ndef evaluate(params, rng, train_loader, val_loader, n_steps=2):\n    # each batch is a tuple(lh, rh, img).

Yes, this could potentially be an issue. Let's break down what's happening:\n\n1. In `evaluate`, each call to `next(train_loader)` advances the generator to the next batch. So when it does:\n```python\nfor _ in range(n_steps):\n    lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)\n    train_loss += loss_fn(params, key_train, lh, img)\n```\nIt's consuming `n_steps` batches from the generator (default 2 batches).\n\n2. When control returns to the training loop:\n```python\nfor step in range(hyperparams['n_steps']):\n    lh, rh, img = next(train_loader)  # This will get the next batch after evaluation\n```\nIt will indeed skip those batches that were used in evaluation.\n\nThis could be problematic because:\n- Some training data might be skipped\n- The randomization of batches might not be as intended\n- It makes the training process less reproducible\n\nA better approach might be to:\n1. Either create separate generators for evaluation\n2. Or save the evaluation batches at the start and reuse them\n3. Or reset the generators after evaluation\n\nHere's how it could be improved:\n```python\ndef evaluate(params, rng, eval_train_loader, eval_val_loader, n_steps=2):\n    train_loss, val_loss = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(n_steps):\n        rng, key_train, key_val = jax.random.split(rng, 3)\n        lh, rh, img = next(eval_train_loader)\n        train_loss += loss_fn(params, key_train, lh, img)\n        lh, rh, img = next(eval_val_loader)\n        val_loss += loss_fn(params, key_val, lh, img)\n    train_loss /= n_steps\n    val_loss /= n_steps\n    return {'train_loss': train_loss, 'val_loss': val_loss}\n\ndef train_loop(rng, opt, train_loader, val_loader, plot_batch, hyperparams):\n    # Create separate evaluation loaders\n    eval_train_loader = make_batches(...)  # Same data as train_loader\n    eval_val_loader = make_batches(...)    # Same data as val_loader\n    \n    # Rest of the code...\n    if (step % (hyperparams['n_steps'] // 100)) == 0:\n        metrics = evaluate(params, key, eval_train_loader, eval_val_loader)\n```\n\nThis way, the training loop's generator won't be affected by evaluation.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5257}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":36},"start":872,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5258}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":37},"start":2547,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5259}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":112},"start":5345,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5260}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":113},"start":7080,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5261}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":338},"start":9160,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5262}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":339},"start":11245,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":5263}}}],"summary":"Understanding Data Batching and Yield Generator","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
