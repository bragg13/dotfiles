It specifies what properties and methods an object should have, acting like a blueprint.\n\nTo use the `GameConfiguration` interface as a return type for your `loadConfigFromFile` function, you would add it after the arrow like this:\n\n```typescript\npublic static loadConfigFromFile(): GameConfiguration {\n  // Function implementation here\n  // Must return an object that matches the GameConfiguration interface structure\n  return {\n    map_board: {\n      spots: new Map(),\n      tiles: new Map(),\n      roads: new Map(),\n      deltas: [],\n      roadsGraph: {}\n    },\n    instance: {\n      hasStarted: false,\n      hasEnded: false,\n      isPaused: false\n    },\n    turn_system: {\n      currentPlayerIndex: 0,\n      players: [],\n      currentRound: 0\n    },\n    game_fsm: {\n      state: 'some_state',\n      setupSteps: []\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nThe function must now return an object that exactly matches the structure defined in the `GameConfiguration` interface. If you try to return an object with missing properties or incorrect types, TypeScript will show an error.\n\nYou can also use interfaces to:\n1. Define parameter types: `function processConfig(config: GameConfiguration)`\n2. Type variables: `let gameConfig: GameConfiguration`\n3. Extend other interfaces: `interface ExtendedConfig extends GameConfiguration`\n\nInterfaces are one of TypeScript's core ways to enforce type safety and provide better development tooling through clear contracts about object shapes.\nwhats the difference to a type then?\nIn TypeScript, `type` and `interface` are very similar, but have some key differences:\n\n1. **Syntax and Purpose**:\n```typescript\n// Interface\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\n// Type\ntype User = {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Extension/Inheritance**:\n```typescript\n// Interfaces can be extended\ninterface Animal {\n  name: string;\n}\ninterface Dog extends Animal {\n  bark(): void;\n}\n\n// Types use intersection\ntype Animal = {\n  name: string;\n}\ntype Dog = Animal & {\n  bark(): void;\n}\n```\n\n3. **Declaration Merging** - Only interfaces can be reopened to add properties:\n```typescript\n// This works with interfaces\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n}\ninterface User {\n  age: number;\n} \n// Result: User has both name and age\n\n// This won't work with types (will error)\ntype User = {\n  name: string;\n}\ntype User = {\n  age: number;\n}\n```\n\n4. **Advanced Features** - Types can do more complex operations:\n```typescript\n// Types can use unions\ntype Status = \"pending\" | \"approved\" | \"rejected\";\n\n// Types can use mapped types\ntype ReadOnly<T> = {\n  readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];\n}\n\n// Types can use conditional types\ntype ExtractArray<T> = T extends Array<infer U> ? U : never;\n```\n\nGeneral Guidelines:\n- Use `interface` when you want to define a contract for object shapes, especially in OOP\n- Use `type` when you need unions, intersections, or other complex type manipulations\n- `interface` is often preferred for public APIs because they are more extensible\n- Both are equally good for simple object type definitions\n\nIn your specific case with `GameConfiguration`, either would work fine. The choice of `interface` suggests it's being used as a contract that other parts of the code need to implement or conform to.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":79}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":1113,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":80}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":30},"start":2671,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":81}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":66},"start":2708,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":82}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":67},"start":4451,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":83}}}],"summary":"Interfaces and TypeScript Return Types","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
