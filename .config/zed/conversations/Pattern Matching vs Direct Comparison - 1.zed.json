The match expression in Solution 1 would be more appropriate if you had multiple tile types that needed different handling.\n\nSolution 1 (match) would be better when:\n1. You have multiple tile types to handle\n2. You need different behavior for each type\n3. You want to ensure you're handling all possible cases (match is exhaustive)\n\nSolution 2 (if) is better when:\n1. You only need to check for one specific condition\n2. The logic is binary (do something or do nothing)\n3. The code is simpler and more readable\n\nFor your current code where you're just checking if the tile is walkable (Floor) or not, Solution 2 is more appropriate and clearer to read. However, if you plan to add more tile types and different behaviors in the future, Solution 1 would be more scalable and safer to maintain.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":1065,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":47}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":1997,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":48}}}],"summary":"Pattern Matching vs Direct Comparison","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
