It follows the standard React hook patterns and conventions:\n\n1. The naming follows the `use` prefix convention for custom hooks\n2. It uses `useState` internally to manage state\n3. Returns a tuple with the state value and setter function (similar to how `useState` works)\n\nThe state structure seems reasonable for a game lobby, tracking:\n- Lobby identifier\n- Game status flags (hasStarted, hasEnded)\n- Game progression (currentRound, currentPlayerIndex)\n- Player list\n\nA few optional suggestions to consider:\n\n1. You might want to add TypeScript types for better type safety:\n```typescript\ninterface LobbyState {\n  lobbyId: string;\n  hasStarted: boolean;\n  hasEnded: boolean;\n  currentRound: number;\n  currentPlayerIndex: number;\n  players: Player[]; // You'd need to define a Player type\n}\n\nexport const useLobbyState = () => {\n  const [lobbyState, setLobbyState] = useState<LobbyState>({...});\n  return [lobbyState, setLobbyState] as const;\n};\n```\n\n2. If you're returning a tuple, you might want to consider returning an object instead for more explicit naming:\n```typescript\nreturn { lobbyState, setLobbyState };\n```\n\nBut these are just suggestions - your current implementation is perfectly valid as is!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":22}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":10},"start":423,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":23}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":1670,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":24}}}],"summary":"Reviewing Lobby State Hook Definition","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
